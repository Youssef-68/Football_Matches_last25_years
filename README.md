# Football_Matches_last25_years
I collected data about Football Matches from 00/01 to 24/25 and Cleaned Data using Pandas library in Python and then stored data in Database using SQL Server. After that I made insights using SQL to filter which part of data I need to get insights from it, and then used Data Visualization tools like Power BI to make a Dashboards.
